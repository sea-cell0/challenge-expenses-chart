## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

  Something I never really used, aside from Bootstrap, was CSS Flexbox and Grid. They are kinda painful to use, I'm not gonna lie. I'm still at the early stages of learning, but I feel like I really grasped the essence of them both, I had no idea that Flexbox is mainly one-dimensional while Grid operates on a two-dimensional scale. However, that can be *kinda* countered on Flexbox by nesting child items

```css
.margin-balance {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  margin: 0.5rem 1.5rem;
  justify-content: space-between;
  
}

.balance-flex {
  display: flow;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.margin-balance img {
  float: right;
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
